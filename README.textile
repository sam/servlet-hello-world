An example of a Servlet app you can run inside a Servlet Container.

h2. Running

You'll need Java and Maven installed. Then you can just run:

bc. mvn jetty:run-war

h2. Results

I'm trying to convert a Ruby web-framework away from the Rack API, and instead run it directly as a Servlet. 
Right now your typical JRuby web-application looks like this:

bq. Client-Request -> Mizuno (Jetty) -> JRuby-Rack (Servlet) -> Rack API -> Ruby Web Application

When it could look like this instead:

bq. Client-Request -> Jetty -> Ruby Web Application

The rest is all pure overhead, translating one platform's standard Web Application Server API to another's.

This application gets *2805* requests-per-second on my work laptop. For comparison, a HelloWorld Rack
application run by Mizuno (Jetty) gets *460* requests-per-second. So removing the overhead makes the example over
six times faster.

That gap is obviously going to narrow as the application grows to actually execute real-world code. Still, it's an
interesting benchmark and a promising optimization.
